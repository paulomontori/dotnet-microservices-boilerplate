# PWorx Microservice BoilerPlate

A **reference implementation** of a lightweight Order Management System that showcases:

* **Domain‚ÄëDriven Design (DDD)** ‚Äì clear separation of Bounded Contexts, rich domain model, Value Objects & Aggregates.  
* **CQRS + Mediator** ‚Äì commands‚ÄØ(write) and queries‚ÄØ(read) handled by MediatR to keep intent explicit and side‚Äëeffects isolated.  
* **SOLID principles** ‚Äì single‚Äëresponsibility, dependency inversion via DI, open/closed domain services, etc.

> **Why this project?**  
> Recruiters and peers can dig into real code that demonstrates clean architecture, scalable patterns and production‚Äëready practices in a bite‚Äësized repo.

```
### Caching Layer
The application now uses **Redis** for caching query results. A view database is accessed via EF Core to serve read models, and cached entries expire after a short period to keep data fresh.

### Observability Layer
**Serilog** handles structured logging while **OpenTelemetry** collects traces and metrics. Metrics are exposed at `/metrics` for Prometheus and can be visualized in **Grafana**.
Global exception handling with structured logs is provided via `ErrorHandlingMiddleware`, and MediatR requests are logged through a `LoggingBehavior`.

## üìù Architecture Decisions

The boilerplate is intentionally opinionated to keep the example small yet realistic. Key design choices include:

* **Bounded Context per Service** ‚Äì the repository focuses on an `OrderService` microservice to illustrate a DDD approach where each context owns its domain model.
* **Minimal API Controllers** ‚Äì endpoints only route HTTP requests and forward them to the application layer. Business logic lives in MediatR handlers to keep controllers lightweight.
* **CQRS with MediatR** ‚Äì commands mutate state while queries load read models. This separation clarifies intent and enables cross-cutting behaviors through pipeline modules.
* **EF Core Write Model** ‚Äì relational persistence is handled via Entity Framework Core with a dedicated `OrderDbContext` and repository. Migrations are code-first for simplicity.
* **Redis-backed View Repository** ‚Äì read operations go through an `OrderViewRepository` that combines EF Core queries with Redis caching to demonstrate a simple read model pattern.
* **Kafka Domain Events** ‚Äì important domain events are published to Kafka using a small `KafkaBroker` abstraction so other services can react asynchronously.
* **Observability by Default** ‚Äì Serilog and OpenTelemetry are integrated from the start with Prometheus scraping enabled at `/metrics`.
* **Docker and Kubernetes** ‚Äì a Dockerfile and `k8s` manifests are provided to run the service in containers and deploy to Azure AKS.

  Domain/                         -- Tests for domain logic
  Infrastructure/                 -- Tests for persistence and middleware
```

The repository separates production code under `src` from test projects in
`tests`. Inside the microservice project, folders map to the main layers of a
Domain‚ÄëDriven Design architecture: `Domain` contains the core business logic,
`Application` handles orchestration and MediatR behaviors, `API` exposes the
HTTP endpoints, and `Infrastructure` isolates data access and cross‚Äëcutting
concerns. Deployment descriptors live in the `k8s` folder so the service can be
packaged and deployed alongside the codebase.

## üìö Library Choices

The project references a minimal set of NuGet packages to keep the example focused yet realistic:

| Package | Reason |
|---------|-------|
| **MediatR** | Implements the mediator pattern to decouple controllers from business logic and enable the CQRS style. |
| **Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi** | Provides the `AddOpenApi` helpers that quickly enable Swagger documentation. |
| **Confluent.Kafka** | Lightweight Kafka client used by the domain to publish events without pulling in an entire messaging framework. |
| **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore** + **Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL** | Gives a modern ORM for the write model backed by PostgreSQL. |
| **Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis** | Adds Redis caching to support the read model repository. |
| **OpenTelemetry** packages | Collect traces and metrics so the service can be observed in production environments. |
| **Serilog.AspNetCore** + **Serilog.Sinks.Console** | Structured logging configured in <code>Program.cs</code> with console output for local development. |


## üöÄ Docker & AKS Deployment

To build the container image locally run:

```bash
docker build -t order-service .
```

Push the image to your registry (e.g. Azure Container Registry) and update the
`image` field in `k8s/deployment.yaml` accordingly. Then apply the manifests to
an AKS cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```
